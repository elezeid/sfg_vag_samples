Hi, I'm SoundFontGuy.  I make samples, music, VSTs, soundfonts and lots of other audio and music production stuff.

This is a collection of some very simple VAG sample files for use with the PS1.

WARNING!!!!

I also included a VAB (this is like the PS1's version of a soundfont).  However this VAB is huge - you will approach the edge of the PS1's audio RAM limit if you use it, but it should still be safe.
