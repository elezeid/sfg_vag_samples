Hi, I'm SoundFontGuy.  I make samples, music, VSTs, soundfonts and lots of other audio and music production stuff.

This is a collection of some very simple VAG sample files for use with the PS1.

This sample also work with PsxSampler VST from BodbDearg.  - https://github.com/BodbDearg/PlayStation1Vsts/

I also included a VAB (this is like the PS1's version of a soundfont).  However this VAB is huge - you will approach the edge of the PS1's audio RAM limit if you use it, but it should still be safe.

These samples are derived from my plugin GuyEngine V2.

More will be added as I create and convert them.
